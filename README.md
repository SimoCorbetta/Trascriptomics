# Trascriptomics
It contains the two projects done for the trascriptomics exam: data analysis of a bulk RNA-seq experiment and a single cell RNA-seq experiment.
Data was analyzed in R using the libraries Seurat and recount3.

In case of bulk RNA-seq, the aim of the project was to identify differential expressed genes in 3 different tissues (brain, colon and kidney) and find eventual marker genes. 

In case of single cell RNA-seq project, the aim  was to identify the different cellular subpopulations of brain cells starting from single-cell sequencing data of mice brain.
